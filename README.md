- Optionals
- Generic methods
    - Creating custom collectors
    - Some random representations
    - TODO: create a generic class, which takes e.g. 2 ArrayLists, and returns a third one, which is:
         
         a)  has as many elements as the bigger one and each element is the SUM of the corresponding two elements<br>
         b)  the INTERSECTION of the two ones (Guava)<br> 
         c)  the UNION of the two ones (Guava)<br>
   
    
- Functional interfaces:
    
    - Lambda
    - Method reference
    - Predicate
    - Supplier
    - Consumer

- Guava
   
    - Collection utilities
    - Preconditions practice
